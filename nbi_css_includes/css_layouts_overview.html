
							<p>This set of CSS layout columns came out of the need to have <strong>multi-column CSS layouts</strong> that would enable the use of <strong>dynamic content while maintaining the integrity of the page</strong>.</p>
							<p>When I first started this project I found many different types of CSS layouts for multi-column pages, each of which fell apart when you started adding floats and clears in the columns.</p>
							
							<p>This is a css layout that is designed to work across all of the major platforms and modern browser combinations, and designed such that you can include any sort of content in the different columns without it interfering with content and layout in other columns.</p>
							
							<p>This CSS layout has been tested and works in the following OS/browser combinations.</p>
							<p>There are very likely others that work that are not listed here. If you test additional OS/browser combinations and would like to have that information added to the list, <a href="http://www.sendryanemail.com" target="_blank">click here to send me an e-mail</a>.
