								<p>If you are a practical web designer that is looking to use a fully compliant CSS layout that:</p>
 
								<ul>
									<li>Validates (both the markup and the CSS)</li>
									<li>Is easy to customize and (relatively easy to) understand</li>
									<li>Maintains it's integrity with floats and clears in the columns</li>
									<li>Does not contain incomprehensible CSS &quot;hacks&quot;</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Then this layout is probably for you.</p>

								<p>If you are an HTML/markup purist and have objections to background graphics and additional markup, this isn't the layout for you.</p>
